# Research Note Organizer (Demo)

This is a small Next.js + TypeScript project created as a code sample.

It demonstrates:
- Clean React component structure and naming
- A typed async hook (`useAsync`) with safe state handling
- Separation between UI and an API-like layer (`lib/analyzeText.ts`)
- Accessible form design (labels, live regions, proper roles)
- Practical loading and error states

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes

The "analysis" call is mocked to simulate an async AI request. The focus is code clarity and UX behavior rather than model quality.
